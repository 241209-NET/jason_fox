# C# Questions
These questions are here to help you engage with the material. We will use these questions to review and to prepare for QC
### .NET Platform
- What is C#?
    - Strongly-typed OOP language created by Microsoft used for a variety of devices included mobile, PC, and servers
- What is .NET Platform?
    - Free, open-source C# development environment for building apps that can run on any platform
    - Includes tools, libraries, and frameworks for building applications
- What is Intermediary Language (IL)?
    - Low level programming lagnauage that acts as a bridge betweeen high-level source code and machine code
    - Also known as bytecode
- What does .csproj file do?
    - Contains all the information needed to build a C# project in Visual Studio
    - Includes list of files, references to external libraries, build settings, etc
    - Equivalent to pom.xml or package.json
- When do we use project reference?
    - Used to directly access code or resources from another project within the same solution
    - Used to manage dependencies between projects duiring development
- What is a solution in .NET?
    - Solutions are the containers for all work in VS.NET
    - Contains a project for each build output
    - Acts as a grouping mechanism to manage multiple projects

### C# Basics
- Which method do I use to write something to the console?
    - Console.WriteLine();
- How about taking user input from the console?
    - Console.ReadLine();
- How do I take a string input and convert to integer and vice versa?
    - Int32.Parse(string); inside a try catch
- Why do we create methods? What are the benefits of compartmentalizing your code?
    - For better code organization and reusability
- What is an array? How do you initialize one?
    - Data structure that allows you to store a elements of the same type under a single variable
    - int[] arr = [];
- What is variable declaration?
    - Specifying the name and data type of the variable
- What is variable initialization?
    - Assigning an initial value to a variable when declaring
- What is the main method? Why is it important?
    - Entry point for the program, it's where the program starts
- Why do we not see the main method after .NET 6?
    - Introduction of top-level statements
        - Executable code written directly at the file level
- Debugger: What are breakpoints? What happens when the program hits the breakpoint?
    - Program is stopped at the breakpoint
    - Developers can inspect the current state of the program, incl variables and memory at the breakpoint
- Debugger: What is step over, step into, step out?
    - Step over: Execute the method as a single step, not interested in debugging
    - Step into: Execute the method step by step to debug
    - Step out: Done debugging method step by step, run the entire method until it returns as one step
- What are exceptions? Why do we use them?
    - Exceptions are used to handle unexpected errors during program execution
    - Used to deal with scenarios that should stop the program from executing if not handled by the developer
- Describe Try/Catch/Finally
    - Try contains the code that may throw an error
    - Catch contains the code that handles the case when an error is thrown
    - Finally always executes after try/catch

### C# Intermediate
- What is class in C#?
    - Template code used to define the structure, attributes, and behaviors of objects
    - User defined data type that combines fields and methods into a single unit
- What are the difference between Value types and Reference types?
    - Values directly contain the data, while references store a pointer to an object
    - Reference lives in the heap
    - Value type lives inline
- What are some collections available in C#? (Beyond List)
    - ArrayList, Queue, Stack, LinkedList, Hashtable, Dictionary
- How do we achieve Abstraction in C#?
    - Use interfaces to define the properties and behaviors of classes
- How do we achieve Encapsulation?
    - Use access modifiers such as private and public to determine data access
- How about Inheritance?
    - Denoted by `:` to show a class extends another or implements an interface
- Polymorphism in C#?
    - Method overloading and overriding
- What is overloading?
    - Multiple methods with the same name but different signatures in the same class
- What is overriding?
    - Method in a child class with the same name and signature but different code
- What's the difference between overloading and overriding
    - Overloading takes place in the same class with different method signatures
    - Overriding takes place in different classes with the same method signatures
- What are properties?
    - Member of a class that provides a flexible mechanism to read, write, or compute the value of a data field
    - Named in proper case
- What are fields?
    - Variable of a given type that is declared in a class or struct
- What are methods?
    - Block of code that only runs when it is called
    - Accepts parameters
- What is constructor?
    - Method used to initialize an object that is called when a class or struct is created
    - Used to set defaults and limit instantiation
- Describe 4 commonly used access modifiers in C#
    - public: accessible by code in any assembly (.dll or .exe created by compiling)
    - private: only accessible by code in the same class/struct
    - protected: only accessible by same class or derived class
    - internal: only accessible by code in the same assembly
    - file: only accessible by code in the same file
- what does static modifier do?
    - Member belongs to the class itself rather than to an instance
    - Called through the class instead of being invoked through an instance
- (T/F) It is perfectly fine to always use the implicit typing instead of strongly typing my variables
    - False
- What is regular expressions? Give me some use cases for regex's.
    - Defines a pattern for matching strings
    - Useful for validation, such as email, phone number, url
- Bonus: What could be a RegEx for validating the email address?
    - \w+\@\w+\.\w+
- What is unmanaged resource and how do you manage it?
    - Resources that the garbage collector doesnt know about
    - Ex: Open files/connections
- What is serialization?
    - Process of converting the state of an object into a form that can be persisted or transported
- What are generic classes? 
    - Classes that encapsulate operations not specific to a particular data type
    - Most common use case is collections like linked lists, hash tables, etc
    - Includes types that take type parameters
- What is boxing and unboxing?
    - Boxing: process of converting a value type to the type object
        - `int i = 123;     object o = i;`
    - Unboxing: reverse of boxing
        - `o = 123;     i = (int)o;`
- What's a struct, and how is it different from class?
    - Value type that can encapsulate data and related functionality
    - Struct is value type, ex: defining a vector with points
    - Class is reference type
- What is lambda expression?
    - Used to create an anonymous function
    - Denoted by `=>`

### Testing
- What do you use to unit test in C#?
    - A testing framework, XUnit for this cohort
- Describe AAA of unit testing
    - Arrange, Act, Assert or Given, Then, When
        - Arrange = Establish testing conditions such as initializing variables
        - Act = Execute the method being tested
        - Assert that the actual results match the expected
- What do you unit test?
    - Unit test methods in your code that can be tested independently
- What do you NOT unit test?
    - Do not test imported/built-in code

### Design Principles
- Describe SOLID
    - Single Responsibility: A class should only have one well-defined responsibility
    - Open/Closed: Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification
    - Liskov Substition: Objects of a superclass should be replaceable by objects of its subclasses without the application breaking
    - Interface Segregation: Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use
    - Dependency Inversion: High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules; both should depend on abstractions, abstractions should not depend on details
- What is Singleton pattern, and when do we use it?
    - Class only has one instances and provides a single point of access to it
    - Useful for logging, drivers, and caching
- what is factory method pattern, and when do we use it?
    - Defined a method for creating an object, but lets subclasses decide which class to instantiate
    - Promotes loose coupling
    - Used when a class can't anticipate the type of object it needs to create
    - Useful for providing users of a library or framework a way to extend internal components
- What is dependency injection, and why do we use it?
    - Used to achieve Inversion of Control
    - Removes responsibility of creating and managing dependencies from a class
    - Constructor injection, property injection, and method injection
    - Makes code more modular, testable, and maintainable
- How does dependency injection differ from dependency inversion?
    - Dependency inversion is a principle about structuring dependencies
        - Creating abstractions and reducting direct dependencies
    - Dependency injection is a pattern for implementing that pattern
        - How those dependencies are provided to the class
- What is separation of concerns principle?
    - Advocates for diving a program into distinct sections
        - Each section addresses a separate concern, where a concern is a set of info that affects the code
    - Ex: MVC design pattern
