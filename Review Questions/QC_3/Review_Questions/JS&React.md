    - string
    - number
    - null
    - undefined
    - symbol
    - bigint
- What are the different ways to declare variables in JS?

    - Values equivalent to a boolean, such as undefined and null === boolean
- What is the difference between == and ===?
    - == returns true if values are equal after type coersion

- What is the event loop in JS?
    - Enables async operations to be executed in a non-blocking manner
    - JS is single threaded, uses a call stack to keep track of function calls being executed
    - Event loop continuously checks if the call stack is empty
    - Executes from callback queue when call stack is empty
- What do async and await do in JS?
    - async keyword creates an asynchronous function that can return a promise
    - await keyword is used when calling an async function to wait for the promise to resolve
- What is a callback function?
    - Function that is passed as an argument to another function
    - Allows first function to execute the second function at a later time
- What is an event listener and why do we use it?
    - Function that waits for an event to occur before executing
    - Used to add interactivity to webpages
- What is hoisting?
    - Variable and function declarations are moved to the top of their scope before code execution
    - Can use a variable or function before it's declared in the code

- What are arrow functions?
    - Concise way to write function expressions
    - Don't have access to `this` keyword
- What are template literals?
    - Similar to template strings in C#
    - Allows using variables inside string declaration
- What are spread & rest operators?
    - Spread operator expands an array or object into its individual elements
    - Rest operator gathers multiple elements into a single array
- What is a promise?
    - Object representing the eventual completion/failure of an async operation
    - Like a placeholder
- What are closures?
    - Combination of a function bundled together with references to its surrounding state
    - Gives access to an outer function's scope from an inner function even after the outer function has finished executing

## Typescript
- What is TS?
    - TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds type safety
- Is TS strongly or weakly typed?
    - Strongly typed
- Why should TS be used?
    - Makes code more readable and maintainable

    - Enums
    - Tuples
    - Any
    - Unknown
    - Void
    - Never
    - Literal types
- What are union types?
    - Allows a variable to hold values of different types
- What are type guards?
    - Expressions that perform runtime checks to ensure variable is of specific type
    - e.g. typeof, instanceof
- What features does TS introduce apart from strong typing & new datatypes?
    - Interfaces, generics, enums, access modifiers, decorators, namespaces, type inference
- What are decorators?
    - ALlows modifying or extending the behavior of classes, methods, properties, or parameters
    - Functions that are applied to declarations
    - Provides a way to add metadata or modify functionality
- How about interfaces?
    - Blueprint for the structure or shape of an object
- How do you declare variables with types?
    - Using : 
- What are two different ways to cast in TS?
    - as keyword    `myVar as string`
    - angle brackets    `<string>myVar`
- How do you type generics in TS?
    - Angle brackets

## Node
- What is node? Why is it used?
    - Runtime environment for JavaScript
    - Allows developers to write server-side applications in JS
- What is npm?
    - Open source registry and package manager for JS

## React SPA

- React state management
- What are props?
    - Way to pass data from parent to child components
    - Similar to function inputs
- What is state?
    - Allows components to manage and store data that can change over time
    - When state changes, components are re-rendered
- Are props mutable? Is state mutable?
    - No
- What is context? Why is it used?
    - Provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down at every level
- How is data sent from a parent component to a child component?
    - Passed as props
- How is data sent from a child component to a parent component (name of the technique & how it’s done)
    - Lifting state up
    - Passing a callback function to a child component such as a setState action

## React rendering
- What is JSX?
    - JavaScript XML
    - Syntax externsion for JS that allows you to write HTML within JS
- What does it mean when there are curly braces { } in the return statement of a component?

- What is conditional rendering?
- How do I display an array of items as individual components in React?

    - Component re-renders when state or props change

## Data & Event binding
- How is data binding done in React (one way binding)?
